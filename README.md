### Week 1 Activities
**Activity 0101**: 

The problem was converting the website to mobile resolution. I had difficulty fully understanding flexbox, using the right html tag, or choosing to change the tag by experimenting on them, time constraint to make changes or correct the little mistakes, bad time management, CSS height, weight, margin properties.

Solution would be managing my time better to be able to consult my lecturer on any issues I had and tweak any little mistake I left unsolved. Also, I focused more on the textbook thinking the PowerPoint presentations were summary of the textbook, without knowing the lecturer provided additional resources and up to date techniques of making website.


**Activity 0102**: 
1. **Corporate coding style guides- HTML Style Guide**:  
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.
Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason. For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks. For readability, add two spaces of indentation, do not use the tab key.

2. **Structural readability features**:  
A single file is fine for very small projects. For large projects, it is smarter to split your CSS across multiple files. So, I should have spilt the stylesheet.css based on font, reset, typography, layouts, forms, lists, tables and so on. It makes it easier to manage and debugging.

3. **Exterior readability features**
    - **Comments**:  
    I should have documented my work by adding comments to each new web page. Comments are useful for both my colleagues and me to revisit those files months or even years after creating them. The comments should include:
        - The page’s filename and location
        - The page’s author and the date the page was initially created.
        - The purpose of each code
        - A list of any supporting files used in the document, such as image and audio files.
        - A list of the files that the page links to and their locations

    - **Naming things**:  
I should have used short, meaningful, and descriptive name.
