### Week 1 Activities
**Activity 0101**: 

The problem was converting the website to mobile resolution. I had difficulty fully understanding flexbox, using the right html tag, or choosing to change the tag by experimenting on them, time constraint to make changes or correct the little mistakes, bad time management, CSS height, weight, margin properties.

Solution would be managing my time better to be able to consult my lecturer on any issues I had and tweak any little mistake I left unsolved. Also, I focused more on the textbook thinking the PowerPoint presentations were summary of the textbook, without knowing the lecturer provided additional resources and up to date techniques of making website.


**Activity 0102**: 
1. **Corporate coding style guides- HTML Style Guide**:  
HTML allows spaces around equal signs. But space-less is easier to read and groups entities better together.
Do not add blank lines, spaces, or indentations without a reason. For readability, add blank lines to separate large or logical code blocks. For readability, add two spaces of indentation, do not use the tab key.

2. **Structural readability features**:  
A single file is fine for very small projects. For large projects, it is smarter to split your CSS across multiple files. So, I should have spilt the stylesheet.css based on font, reset, typography, layouts, forms, lists, tables and so on. It makes it easier to manage and debugging.

3. **Exterior readability features**
    - **Comments**:  
    I should have documented my work by adding comments to each new web page. Comments are useful for both my colleagues and me to revisit those files months or even years after creating them. The comments should include:
        - The page’s filename and location
        - The page’s author and the date the page was initially created.
        - The purpose of each code
        - A list of any supporting files used in the document, such as image and audio files.
        - A list of the files that the page links to and their locations

    - **Naming things**:  
I should have used short, meaningful, and descriptive name.

**Activity 0201**:

Identify the values inherent to the app that might help to identify the target user base 
- It informs- people inform you about things that is happening around them
- It communicates – you can communicate freely and effectively with people
- It connects or network – you can have communication with different and unique people in your vicinity or around the world
- It saves person money – you are not required to pay extra for calling people in a domesticated or international setting, just pay for only internet plan to enable free communication with anybody from anywhere
- It maintain relationship – communicating with your friends, parents, family, lover etc can maintain a level of familiarity and ensure you continue to know lots of things about them to maintain a relationship.
- It ensures sales or profit making – communicate with sellers to reserve product and send payments

Briefly describe the target user base. 
- People with compatible phone
- People with functional internet
- People who like to interact with different and new people
- People who desire to maintain connection with families and friends

Do your goals in using the app match those of the target user base?
- Yes, I communicate with variety of people and maintain a relationship with family and friends

**Activity 0202**:

Examine the identifiers (i.e. variable and method names, etc.) used in the code. Are they sufficiently descriptive? Are they perhaps too descriptive (i.e. too long, or to complicated). 
- Yes they are generally short and precise

Do they make sense in the context of your project? 
- Since the project deals with creating a Restaurant website, navigation list, class and identifier like Home,Menu, Reservation, testimonal perfectly suit it

Identify between five and ten names in the code that you could consider changing either to be more descriptive, or more consistent with one another.
- paragraph – introduction
- testimonial – recommendation
- author – customer
- slide – picHeader
- menuHeader - menuSubTitle
- menu - menuItem

**Activity 0301**:
- Similar Home Page, play and connect
- Download selector icon is a little different
- The three dots for option are different: Iphone is horizontal, android is vertical
- Add to Home Screen option is available on android but not on ios
- On the browse page, the way genre list are portrayed is different: ios is row position with simple icons, android is in column position in a colourful rectangle
- New release page for android has a fading from colour to black linear gradient background colour tone, ios has a smaller section for the title.
- Filter option of the android is simple and small, in ios the filter option overshadows the screen with a translucent background.
- Podcasts categories page on android has colourful rectangle, ios has simple icons in front of rectangular pictures
- The podcasts categories when selected as fade from picture to black linear gradient for the titles on ios e.g top podcast, android just has a fading from colour to black linear gradient background colour tone
 - All artists list on Library page for ios is alphabetically with the alphabet letter crammed together at the right side of page, on andriod the artist list has alphabet on top of artists name strating with the same alphabet.

**Activity 0302**:
- Animation of icon or images informs the user about an action. It enables a subtle change of UI to the awareness of the user. It can provide a smooth and realistic movement of an object.  It changes the layout within a activity and between layouts in separate activities.
- The documentation structure provides general definition with illustrative examples attached to it. It provides codes and links to expand more on the topic.

**Activity 0401**:
- Slack: ONBOARDING - Sign Up Flows
1. Skeleton Views:

When loading the app after completing the signing process, the skeleton view is first displayed to create the feeling that the app will soon load the images and info. It encourages patience and anticipation from the user, rather than displeasure. It occurs because the network is not fast enough for the app. It appears in form of grey rectangle for images, grey circle for profile, grey slightly rounded rectangle with a small height for the text and so on. 

2. Two-Step Authentication:

Ensuring the email address is valid, a six-digit confirmation code is sent to the email to enter in the app. It is for security purpose which occurs by generating a one time password remotely from the app server and is shared with user through the SMS or email to be typed in, thereby completing part of the log in process. 

**Activity 0402**:

- The second exercise is more orthogonal because you are not tied to a particular product or file, so it is reusable. The concept of orthogonality relates to MVC because it follows similar principle of decoupling your code and avoiding duplicating codes. This is for the purpose of isolating the code to make changes and fixes to some parts of it without affecting the overall project for the worst.

**Activity 0501**:

- MVC (model-view-controller) – Model is the business logic of the project with no tie to the view or controller, so reusable and testable. View is the visual representation of the project, UI, that communicates with the controller when the user interacts with the project. It is more connected to the Controller which ensures flexibility. Controller is the middleman that connects the view to the model. It is difficult to test and inflexible because of its strong coupling with view, which can almost be an extension, and can be overloaded with too code. It is for simple project.

- MVP (Model–view–presenter) - Model has the same function as MVC. View now has the Activity and a view interface to allow unit testing. Presenter is similar to the controller from MVC with its own interface and no ties to the View, which ensures testability and flexibility. But it can receive more business logic over time, which makes it difficult to maintain. It is for more complex project but could increase the number of codes in the project.

- MVVM (Model–view–viewmodel) - Model has the same function as MVC. Views binds to observables and actions shown by the ViewModel. ViewModel wraps the model and provides observable data for the view to use. It also passes events from the view to the model, with no ties to the view. MVVM is testable and independent, but view can receive presentation logic over time in the xml if values are not taken directly from the ViewModel, so makes maintenance difficult. It is for more complex project that can have less codes.

**Activity 0502**:
- I can avoid global variables by ensuring that i only ever pass anything to or from functions via parameters & return values.
